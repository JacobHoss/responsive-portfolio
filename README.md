# Resonsive Portfolio

The purpose of this responsive-portfolio is to demonstrate my ability to utilize Bootstrap Components and the Grid System. 

## The "Responsive" Part

The objective in regards to responsiveness was to create a portfolio that was visually appealing on a mobile device. It took me some trial-and-error, but I finally got it to a point where it looks great on my own phone. 

## Design and Spacing  

I used media queries to make some design changes as the screen width decreased. Any window larger than 980 pixels has the main content positioned to the left of the screen. There is some margin on the left and top to make it more visually appealing. Furthermore, any window with a pixel width less than 640 shows the navbar brand stretched across the entirety of the window. I accomplished that with a media query. 

## BootStrap

BootStrap was a huge time-saver! I'm sure I could have designed the whole website with my own CSS Sheet, but it would have taken more time to accomplish. 

## CSS Styling

I needed to modify existing BootStrap classes to match the styling on the provided wireframe. This gave me experience on working with CSS and BootStrap in conjunction.
